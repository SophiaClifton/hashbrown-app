          <h3>Correct Answer!</h3>
          <p>Since Emily is in a lower tax bracket now and expects her income to increase in the future, using a TFSA makes more sense. She won't get a big immediate tax break from an RRSP at her current income level, and withdrawals from a TFSA are tax-free later. She can keep her future RRSP contribution room for when she's in a higher tax bracket and will get a larger tax deduction.</p>
          <h4>Why the Other Options Are Less Ideal:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A. RRSP: Contributing to an RRSP in a low tax bracket provides a smaller tax deduction. She might benefit more from deferring those RRSP contributions until her income is higher, so the tax deduction is more valuable.</li>
            <li>C. High-Interest Savings Account (HISA): While safe and relatively liquid, the interest earned is taxable in a non-registered account, and rates may be lower than potential investment returns in a TFSA.</li>
            <li>D. Non-Registered Brokerage Account: Investment growth would be taxable every year (for dividends, interest) or upon sale (capital gains), which is less efficient than the tax-free growth of a TFSA.</li>
